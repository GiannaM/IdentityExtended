# Identity Extended
 
Library provides a simple identity library encapsulating the Microsoft Identity abstractions. There are several abstractions that can be clean by forking and proving your own User object.

**Note** for further simplification a custom PasswordHasher can be added and the reference to Microsoft Identity library can be moved all-together.
